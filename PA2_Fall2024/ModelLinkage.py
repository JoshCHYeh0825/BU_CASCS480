    ##### TODO 2: Model the Creature
    # Build the class(es) of objects that could utilize your built geometric object/combination classes. E.g., you could define
    # three instances of the cyclinder trunk class and link them together to be the "limb" class of your creature. 
    #
    # In order to simplify the process of constructing your model, the rotational origin of each Shape has been offset by -1/2 * dz,
    # where dz is the total length of the shape along its z-axis. In other words, the rotational origin lies along the smallest 
    # local z-value rather than being at the translational origin, or the object's true center. 
    # 
    # This allows Shapes to rotate "at the joint" when chained together, much like segments of a limb. 
    #
    # In general, you should construct each component such that it is longest in its local z-direction: 
    # otherwise, rotations may not behave as expected.
    #
    # Please see Blackboard for an illustration of how this behavior works.
